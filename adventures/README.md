# Introduction

Welcome to the Act Collection for *Panoptikon*. This collection offers a series of interconnected acts that together construct the narrative of *A Memory Gone*. Each act is designed to be followed in a specific order, where each step contributes to a larger and more intricate story.

Before the first act begins, you will find an introduction that describes the current situation and sets the stage for the adventure. This includes a detailed description of the location where the events will unfold, as well as guidance to help you effectively weave together the different parts of the narrative.

We wish you a great deal of enjoyment!
